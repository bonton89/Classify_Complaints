# Classify_Complaints
It's a binary text classification use case. In this project, we have built a text classification system using Azure Language Services to categorize texts as complaints or non-complaints.


Hybrid Azure Language Service Model for Text Classification
Objective: Build a binary text classification system using Azure Language Services to categorize texts as complaints or non-complaints.
Approach:		Combine Azure Custom Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis models for enhanced accuracy.
 		Leverage the strengths of both models to gain insights into customer sentiments and intentions.
Deployment using Pywebio and Flask:
		 Utilize Pyweb.io to seamlessly deploy the classification model as an interactive web application.
		Enable users to input text, and receive real-time predictions.
